"""The go-out window has to be true at the hour it is read.

Measured on 2026-08-10 at 17:52 IST, every driver returned a window already in
the past: PM2.5 "Late morning (about 9 AM-12 PM)" six hours gone, ozone "Early
morning (about 6-9 AM)" nine hours gone, traffic gases "Midday (about 11 AM-3
PM)" three hours gone. `best_window` read `clock.today_ist().month` for the
season and never read the hour at all. It renders under "IF YOU MUST GO OUT",
so at five in the afternoon the most actionable line on the page was guaranteed
wrong -- and it is the one claim a reader can check against their own clock.

Sixteen tests already covered this module and none of them caught it, because
they were written from the implementation and inherited its assumption that the
answer does not depend on the time. So every test here freezes the clock: time
is an input dimension, like language and viewport.

The first two blocks pin the branches that were already CORRECT before this
change -- severe air and no reading -- because a refactor that ranks "the hours
left today" is exactly the kind that hands them a cheerful hour.
